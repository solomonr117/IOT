# IOT

Purpose : 
     This project is a simple one which tells us how can we make any devices in our home smarter which enables us to control any device from anywhere in the world using our smartphone.
     
Pre-requisites : 
    ðŸ‘‰ Node MCU - ESP 8266 (Microcontroller)
    ðŸ‘‰ Arduino Software 
    ðŸ‘‰ Android Studio Software 
    ðŸ‘‰ Smart Phone 
    ðŸ‘‰ Seamless Internet Connection

Arduino Code :  
     This code helps you to connect your ESP8266 (Microcontroller) to firebase database which is Google's realtime database.
     
Configuring your Arduino software for Libraries : 
    ðŸ‘‰ In the Tools Section of Arduino's Menubar,Go to Board manager and search for esp8266 and install the 2.3.0 version.
    ðŸ‘‰ In the Sketch Section of Arduino's Menubar,Go to Library manager and add include this library-                                               https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/firebase-arduino
    ðŸ‘‰ In the Sketch Section of Arduino's Menubar,Go to Library manager and add this library by going to include library section or press          Ctrl+Shift+I - Arduino Json Library by Benoit Blanchon version 5.13.5 .
